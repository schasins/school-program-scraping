The Academy of Arts and Sciences is dedicated to providing each student with a nurturing and individualized learning experience. We are here to promote self-advocacy, foster social awareness, and cultivate creative problem-solving skills. We foster an environment where all students are accepted and nurtured to be who they are, and teachers and staff on campus form a network of caring adults who work to meet the needs of every student so they can be academically and socially successful.  The Academy averages approximately 350 students per year.
The Academy’s small school setting allows our teachers to create an effective learning environment by working closely with students and their families in building a strong community.   Within this community, teachers are able to give more individual attention to students and communicate regularly with parents.
Our administrators, like our teachers, work to individualize experiences for stakeholders by welcoming parents to drop in to school whenever they like discuss the best way to serve families.  As a small school, between our three administrators we know every student on campus and are very hands on with all student support issues that arise. 
The Academy offers a rigorous and relevant curriculum to meet the needs of our diverse student body, and students receive rigorous college counseling all four years aided by a full-time academic counselor, a half-time counselor and a full-time college counselor funded by the SF Bar Association’s School-to-College program.

*DELIM*[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,*,11,12,13,14]
We offer an advisory section for each 9th through 12th grade student.  Every Tuesday and Thursday, from 1:10 to 1:40 PM students meet in groups of 18 to 20 with a grade-level teacher advisor.  The objective of this advisory section is to help ensure that each student at the Academy has a meaningful connection with an adult at school, while increasing community, academic success and attendance rates.  Students engage in goal setting, attendance and students planner checks and receive important information. There are monthly grade-level meetings and once a grading period there are all-school meetings.

*DELIM*[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14]
The Academy shares a campus with the School of the Arts, as well as an administration.  Carmelo Sgarlato serves as Principal for both schools, while Greg Markwith and Gary Pacini serves both schools as Assistant Principals.  However, Greg Markwith oversees much of the day-to-day operations of the Academy, as well working with the staff to undertake initiatives to move the school forward.

IMPORTANT ATTENDANCE REMINDERS!
AAS Community:

There have been some questions recently about how AAS students get the re-admit slips they need to show teachers that their absence was excused.  Please make sure to follow the below steps:

1.  Student is absent.   They turn in a note the day they return to school, which goes into the box on Margarita's door.

2.  The next day students go to her office before school, at lunch or after school and pick up a re-admit slip from Margarita (if absence is excused)

3.  Student shows re-admit slip to teachers to show absence is unexcused.

Thank you for all of your help following these procedures.

Greg Markwith,

Principal

3. Estudiante debe mostrar el pase de re-admición a los maestros para mostrar que su ausencia es justificada.

School Overview


Our Mission and Philosophy
Alvarado is more than a school; it is a community. We are a school of languages, a school of arts, a school of cultures and social justice. Our mission is to reach and teach the heart and soul of the child through a fertile language experience, math, the arts and sciences. 

Academic Program
Our teachers follow the curriculum established by the San Francisco Unified School District. This curriculum is based on McGraw Hill for language arts, Everyday Math for mathematics, Macmillan for social studies, and FOSS for science. 

Faculty and Staff
We are extremely fortunate to have an enthusiastic, energetic, and committed group of professionals working at Alvarado. Click here to see a personal statement and bio from our Principal, Robert Broecker.

Parental Involvement
Without our parents, Alvarado would not be the school it is. We expect and encourage families to be involved in the classroom, on field trips, at events or behind the scenes.

The Kindergarten Experience
Kindergarteners are gently introduced to the wider school, which, at more than 500 students, can be intimidating.

We Work to Combat Bullying
Alvarado does not have more problems with bullying than any other school, but we take the issue seriously when it arises. We host workshops, educate our students, parents and teachers, and provide resources for all.

Click on the links below for more information.

Anti-Bullying Policy
We help children to be included and to feel safe and empowered. We teach children to include others in work and play, and we teach by example: Staff and parents model kindness, respect, empathy and cooperation with students and each other. Please read our school policy on bullying in English or in Spanish. We also have a more easily understood policy that is appropriate for children.

For clarity, we also have a flowchart that illustrates how the school responds to reported incidents of bullying.

Resources for Parents
There are many books available to help parents raise empathetic children or cope with bullying. If you know of a book that is not on this list, please email the title to Morgan Benz.

Martial Arts Programs
Martial arts are excellent training for the mind and body. Martial arts students gain a sense of security as they learn techniques that can protect them in potentially harmful situations.

 

Frequently Asked Questions
What is bullying?
Bullying occurs when a student, or group of students, attempts to take power over another student. Often bullying is repeated, where students fall into the roles of bully (the student who is bullying), bully-follower (a student who goes along with the bully), target (the student who is being bullied) and bystander (a student who sees bullying but does nothing to stop it). The main ways in which bullying happens are:

Physical bullying: when a student uses physical force to hurt another student by hitting, punching, pushing, pantsing, shoving, kicking, spitting, pinching, getting in their way, or holding them down. It is also bullying to interfere with another student’s belongings, to take or break their possessions, and to demand or steal money.

Verbal bullying: when a student directs words at another student with the intention of putting them down or humiliating them. This includes threatening, taunting, intimidating, shouting, insulting, sarcasm, name-calling, teasing, put-downs and ridiculing. It is also verbal bullying when a student uses hostile gestures towards another student, such as making faces, staring, giving the evil eye, and eye rolling.

Relational bullying: when a student influences another student’s friendships and relationships through deliberately leaving them out, spreading gossip and rumors about them, whispering, giving them the silent treatment, ostracizing or scape-goating. This also includes writing words or creating cartoons, posters or drawings about another student designed to hurt or humiliate that student.

Cyber bullying: using mobile phones, text messages, e-mails, instant messaging, chatrooms, web blogs and social networking sites to bully another student in any of the ways described above. Examples of cyber bullying are sending threatening or insulting messages by phone and e-mail, posting untrue information or embarrassing pictures about another student on message boards, blogs or social networking sites such as MySpace or Facebook, using another student’s email address or IM name to send messages that make the student look bad, creating a web page devoted to putting down another student, forwarding a text-message or e-mail that was meant for your eyes only.

Is bullying the same as harassment?
Bullying is part of a continuum of aggression and may, at times, amount to harassment. Harassment occurs when a student is the recipient of threatening, disturbing or unwelcome behaviors because of a particular characteristic. See our anti-bullying policy for more details on how harassment is addressed.

What do I do if I think my child is being bullied at school?
Talk to your child’s teacher first. Classroom teachers often have great insight into the dynamics of children’s relationships. Take the first step by sharing your concerns. Your child’s teacher will talk to you about the best way to address the situation. If you have additional concerns, you can also speak with Mr. Broecker.

What do I do if my child is bullying another child?
The first step is the same. Talk to your child’s teacher. Classroom teachers and support staff at Alvarado are available to assist all children and their families, regardless of the role they might play in a situation involving bullying.

Where can I get more information?
Check out our reading list for both kids and parents. There are also a number of useful websites:

For parents:

http://www.stopbullying.gov A U.S. government managed website with a wealth of information.

http://nobully.com The local consultancy that is currently working with Alvarado.

http://www.commonsensemedia.org a useful site which gives summaries, age recommendations and reviews for books, movies, video games and more.

http://www.staysafeonline.org/in-the-home/protect-your-children Good tips on how to keep your children safe online.

For kids:

http://kidshealth.org/kid/feeling/school/poll_bullying.html#cat20067

What else can I do?
Model compassionate behavior. In order for children to learn kindness and empathy, they need to see it modeled by adults. Make sure your kids get to see you behaving in a compassionate, empathetic manner. A positive social climate is key to a school’s success in combating bullying.

Volunteer at recess time. While we have seen great improvement since starting our Playworks program in 2010, the yard remains a potential hotspot for bullying. The more adults that are present, the easier it is to handle minor conflicts as they arise, before they grow into more serious, negative patterns.

Limit children’s exposure to media.  Talk to your children about the TV programs they watch and make sure they are age-appropriate. Monitor their online activities and teach kids how to be safe online.

Alvarado Elementary School
Anti-Bullying Policy
If you want to be happy, practice compassion.” -Dalai Lama
Our Social Vision
At Alvarado we are all ethnicities, religions, orientations, abilities and backgrounds. No matter where 
we come from, we are one inclusive community. We celebrate our differences. 
We help children to be included and to feel safe and empowered. We teach children to actively include 
others in work and play.
To teach by example, staff and parents model kindness, respect, empathy and cooperation with students 
and each other.
Purpose of this policy
In any school community, there will be occasions when students do not get along. Sometimes conflicts 
arise between students that they find too big or persistent to resolve by themselves. Sometimes students 
bully in an attempt to hurt, exclude or take power from another student. These behaviors may be 
motivated by hurt feelings, anger, jealousy, insecurity, attention-seeking or lack of skill in dealing with 
conflict. Whatever their underlying cause, bullying and unresolved conflict stand in the way of our 
vision. This policy is designed to guide us in how to respond to student conflict and bullying, how to 
learn and play together as a community and how to live by the core values of kindness, empathy, and 
inclusiveness contained in our social vision.
Scope of this policy
This policy applies to all students, parents, staff, coaches and all other adults on our campus, whether 
employed by the school, San Francisco Unified School District, working as contractors, or volunteers. 
This policy governs student behavior both on our campus, at School or SFUSD school-sponsored events, 
and also when students are traveling to and from school.
The PEACETeam
• The PEACE Team is a permanent committee to ensure the implementation of this policy, to oversee 
the social and emotional development of our students and to help our school live by our values of 
kindness and inclusiveness contained in our vision statement. PEACE stands for: PracticeEmpathy
AndCaring withEveryone.
• The principal appoints the team leader(s).
• The team leader shall convene meetings regularly throughout the school year.Alvarado Elementary School Anti-Bullying Policy 2
How Our School Responds to Incidents of conflict
Conflict occurs when two or more students disagree because each perceives the other as getting in the 
way of their needs, concerns or goals. Conflict becomes bullying when one of the students attempts to 
take power over another to resolve the conflict. When students become stuck in a persistent or disruptive 
conflict, but are not bullying, we bring the students together and use TALK, a quick and effective 
protocol, to facilitate conflict resolution. We encourage our parents to follow this protocol at home to 
reinforce what we teach at school. We encourage students to follow this same protocol when talking 
through a peer conflict without the help of an adult. Here is the protocol we use for TALKing it through.
TALK PROTOCOL
Agree to talk it through without putdowns and interruptions.
Tell what happened and how you feel. 
Each of the two students takes a turn to say what happened 
and to name the emotions that they feel,
 while the other student listens.
Ask for what you need. Each student takes a turn 
to make specific requests for what they need from the other.
Look for solutions. The students brainstorm together
what might solve the problem for both of them. 
This is known as looking for a “win-win” solution.
Try to find at least three solutions. 
Keep the best solution. Make an agreement and 
Commit to following that agreement.
It aids resolution if the adult follows up with the two studentsto check that they have successfully solved 
the problem. If the problem has not been solved, figure out why the initial solution did not work repeat 
the TALK process, and look for new solutions.Alvarado Elementary School Anti-Bullying Policy 3
How Our School Responds to Incidents of Bullying
We are committed to a culture where we have kindness, empathy, and inclusiveness. We see bullying 
and harassment as obstacles to realizing our values for how we all get along. The following part of this 
policy describes our roles in responding to bullying and in supporting the culture of Alvarado School.
What we mean by bullying 
Bullying occurs when a student, or group of students, attempts to take power over another student. 
Often bullying is repeated, where students fall into the roles of bully (the student who is bullying), 
bully-follower (a student who goes along with the bully), target (the student who is being bullied) and 
bystander (a student who sees bullying but does nothing to stop it). The main ways in which bullying 
happens are:
Physical bullying: when a student uses physical force to hurt another student by hitting, punching, 
pushing, pantsing, shoving, kicking, spitting, pinching, getting in their way, or 
holding them down. It is also bullying to interfere with another student’s 
belongings, to take or break their possessions, and to demand or steal money.
Verbal bullying: when a student directs words at another student with the intention of putting them 
down or humiliating them. This includes threatening, taunting, intimidating, 
shouting, insulting, sarcasm, name-calling, teasing, put-downs and ridiculing. It is 
also verbal bullying when a student uses hostile gestures towards another student, 
such as making faces, staring, giving the evil eye, and eye rolling. 
Relational bullying: when a student influences another student’s friendships and relationships through 
deliberately leaving them out, spreading gossip and rumors about them, whispering, 
giving them the silent treatment, ostracizing or scape-goating. This also includes 
writing words or creating cartoons, posters or drawings about another student 
designed to hurt or humiliate that student. 
Cyber bullying refers to the use of mobile phones, text messages, e-mails, instant messaging, 
chatrooms, web blogs and social networking sites to bully another student in any of 
the ways described above. Examples of cyber bullying are sending threatening or 
insulting messages by phone and e-mail, posting untrue information or 
embarrassing pictures about another student on message boards, blogs or social 
networking sites such as MySpace or Facebook, using another student’s email 
address or IM name to send messages that make the student look bad, creating a 
web page devoted to putting down another student, forwarding a text-message or email that was meant for your eyes only.
When bullying is also harassment. Bullying is part of a continuum of aggression and may, at times, 
amount to harassment. Harassment occurs when a student is the recipient of threatening, disturbing or 
unwelcome behaviors because of a particular characteristic. Sexual Harassment includes, but is not 
limited to, unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct 
of a sexual nature. Sexual harassment can be directed toward a student under conditions such as the 
following: verbal, written, physical, and visual. Sexual harassment is dealt with under the sexual 
harassment policy that you can find at the end of this policy.

Parent Teacher Association
The Alvarado PTA works hand-in-hand with the school’s administration to organize events and programs and to raise the funds necessary to realize these activities. Through the efforts of the PTA, we have hired staff to assist with reading comprehension, literacy, math, technology, and community outreach. PTA funds are also used to offer enrichment classes in art, music and science that reinforce and augment the core curriculum.
See volunteer opportunities here.

Become a voting member of the PTA today! Membership must be renewed every year and costs $10 per person. Click here for more details. Questions about the Alvardo PTA? Contact presidents Steve Sacks and Sarah Monroy at president@alvaradoschool.net.

Events
Every year the PTA organizes many events, such as the fall family picnic, spring carnival, and our annual fundraising auction. These events build community and are fun for all involved. See what’s on tap for this year or visit the calendar for specific dates.

Enrichment Programs
Thanks to our parents, Alvarado is able to offer an array of enrichment programs, from art to PE to literacy support. Learn more about the committees that support these programs and find out how you can volunteer.

Communications
We are in the process of transitioning to a new system called SchoolPages, a secure school-wide directory and communications system. Register here so you can communicate with your classroom, sign up for snack and volunteer activities and find out what is happening in your classroom on your class page. This is a new system we have been using for less than a year, so some classrooms are less active than others.

We encourage suggestions on how to make using SchoolPages even better. Questions? Comments? Please email Audrey Vernick at SchoolPages@alvaradoschool.net.

Though it will eventually be replaced by a similar feature in SchoolPages, at present Alvarado’s Yahoo group is a great way to stay connected with an active group of Alvarado parents. It’s a forum for exchanging ideas and information, and for staying up-to-date on the latest school information. Learn more or sign up now! (Note: You will need to set up a Yahoo account.)

Special Education and Inclusion
Alvarado proudly supports two Special Education classrooms and an inclusion education for the 10 percent of our students who have Individualized Education Plans (IEPs).

Special Education
We have two Special Education classes, one for grades K to 2 and one for grades 3 to 5.

Children from the Special Education classes are an important part of our community. They join their fellow students in the General Education classes for about a half-hour each day, for recess and for field trips.

To learn more about the district’s Special Education program, please click here.

Inclusion
Alvarado strives to include children with disabilities within the General Education program in a way that is determined by the child’s family and the school district. SFUSD provides a variety of services to support their needs.

Our Principal and staff are engaged, proactive and invested in inclusion, and dedicated to being a model school.

Special Education & Inclusion resources and facilities include:
Full-time Inclusion Specialist

Resource Specialist who provides appropriate accommodations and modifications to the core curriculum to help students succeed in general education classrooms.

Aptos encourages students to achieve at the highest levels, both academically and socially. At Aptos, students feel comfortable, nurtured, and respected. They are actively and positively engaged in a safe environment. We encourage students to develop a sense of responsibility, discipline, and self-esteem. The comprehensive academic program includes General Education classes, intensive English classes for English Language Learners, Special Education programs and Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) and honors classes. Students have the opportunity to participate in elective classes that engage their creativity, encourage development of multiple intelligences, and deliver opportunities for leadership. Students can select interests such as drama, computers, arts, journalism, chorus, orchestra, band, and jazz band. The curriculum is balanced by our physical education and student support programs. Some of our other programs include student government, stage crew, Journalism, Beta Club Honor Society, Guitar Club, and Italian Club.
All students have access to advanced classes, such as honors classes, as well as electives, support services, and highly qualified, trained, and skilled teachers. We set and meet high expectations through interesting, stimulating learning activities and clear student evaluations. We believe that every student should feel safe, secure, and heard.

AVID @ APTOS
AVID is currently in its second year at Aptos Middle School.  There are two classes of the AVID elective, one at 7th grade and one at 8th grade.  

In the 7th grade elective class, AVID students are introduced to the 4 components of the AVID curriculum: Writing, Inquiry, Collaboration, and Reading.  A major emphasis in the 7th grade is for students to develop inquiry and collaboration skills as students work with college students during tutorials sessions.  

 

In the 8th grade elective class, AVID students continue to develop their WICR strategies needed for high school and college, but further look at the importance of choosing the right high school and the requirements needed to apply to a college / university.  

 

Both elective classes support students in their core classes of Math, English/Language Arts, Social Studies, and Science through tutorials and various in class assignments.  The AVID elective class is not a remedial or intervention class.  The curriculum is rigorous and pushes students to become their own advocates in an academic setting to hone their skills in their other classes. 

 

Highlights: * Field Trips - Stanford and San Francisco State University; Washington HS and Lincoln HS; Day at Law School (UC Hastings) * Guest Speakers on Fridays * College mentors and tutors leading tutorials twice a week

MISSION
AVID's mission is to close the achievement gap by preparing all students for college readiness and success in a global society.

WHAT IS AVID?
AVID, Advancement Via Individual Determination, is a college readiness system for elementary through postsecondary that is designed to increase schoolwide learning and performance. The AVID College Readiness System (ACRS) accelerates student learning, uses research based methods of effective instruction, provides meaningful and motivational professional learning, and acts as a catalyst for systemic reform and change.

Building Evacuation Plan
(updated 2-20-13)
 	
February is Homework Awareness Month at Lowell.
This is an opportunity for all of us--students, teachers, and parents--to think about homework, learn about homework,
and take steps to ensure that homework works for us.
Here's what to know:
Homework Log will be distributed to each student during reg on Monday 2/10.  Students will keep track of how much time they spend doing their homework for the following two weeks (2/10 – 2/23)
Homework Survey will be given to each student during reg on Tuesday 2/25.  Students will use the information from their homework logs to complete the homework survey.
Why? WASC investigation showed that homework was a major contributor to student stress levels.
The activities during Homework Awareness Month will be used to collect data so we may begin a dialogue on this issue.
The data will be shared with the Lowell Community later in the spring.
Homework Awareness Month is brought to you by Lowell Challenge Success and  WASC Committees

Philosophy
Underlying Lowell 's philosophy of education is the resolve that the young people of San Francisco continue to enjoy their traditional option of attending a college preparatory public high school. The emphasis requires an instructional program that promotes sound intellectual and aesthetic values while providing opportunities for self-discipline and individual decision-making.
Lowell endeavors to create a just and equitable society where individual responsibilities are clearly defined and personal rights guaranteed. It endorses the concept of an integrated school where cultural and social diversity enrich the lives of all students.

"I'm excited to share with you that seven of your Cardinal softball players made grand headlines as they were part of the San Bruno Storm team that just finished up a week-long softball trip at the ASA Western "B" Nationals Championships in San Diego, CA. In fact, all seven players were crucial in helping the team capture the 2013 Championship."

Lowell senior Elijah Saunders barely wiped the smashed cupcake from his face following his team's 7-0 San Francisco Section championship victory over Washington on Wednesday.

The right-handed pitcher and left-handed hitter just let all the sweet morsels soak in.

It was tasty enough to pitch a four-hitter with eight strikeouts and lead the Cardinals to their 18th section title, but first since 2008. Also flavorful were his three doubles, including a key two-run blast down the right-field line in a four-run fourth.

The Lowell Robotics Team Qualifies for Worlds
The Lowell Robotics team, a F.I.R.S.T ( For Inspiration & Recognition of Science & Technology ) student-run competitive robotics team, attended Silicone Valley Regional ( SVR ) this past weekend at SJSU. With our alliance team, it has qualified for the F.I.R.S.T World Championship 2013 at St. Louis at the end of April.

Out of 58 participating teams at SVR (many of whom have been around since the beginning of F.I.R.S.T more than 15 years ago) our robotics team was ranked as high as 6th on the 1st day of the competition, and ended the 2-day tournament with the rank of 18th as an individual team, but ranked 2nd with our alliance team at the end of semi-final.

This is the second time in 2 years that the team has qualified for the F.I.R.S.T World Championship, and the team is less than 2 years old. In 2012, the Lowell Robotics team ( FRC team 4159, aka Cardinalbotics ) qualified for the World Championship through being awarded Rookie All Star.

About Attendance
LOWELL HIGH SCHOOL
ATTENDANCE POLICY
It is expected that Lowell students will attend school regularly.  It has been our experience that more than five days of absence for any reason in an eighteen-week semester results in poor grades.
                  Re-admit Slip – if a student is absent, the parent or guardian should call the Attendance Office at 415-759-2730 ext. 3167.  The student’s name and registry number should be given.  When the student returns to school, s/he must bring a note signed by the parent or guardian to room 131 – the Attendance Office (Ms. Lee) in order to obtain a “Re-admit” slip.  Re-admit slips are issued daily between 7:15 and 10:30 A.M.  (Think early! Don’t be late for Registry!) No Permits-to-Leave school will be issued during registry.  Between 9:40-10:30 AM after Registry, Re-Admits and PTL’s will be issued by Ms. Schmidt in room 104.  A student must secure the signatures from all his/her teachers and return the Re-admit slip to the Dean within THREE DAYS of the absence.
                  Permit-To-Leave Slip (PTL for App’t) – if a student needs to leave early/during the day due to a DR./DDS appointment/other (not illness), s/he needs to bring a signed parent note to the Attendance Office or to Ms. Schmidt according to the times listed in the Re-admit section.  Students must have the PTL signed by the parent/guardian and returned the following morning.
                  Permit-To-Leave Slip (PTL for Illness) – if a student becomes ill during the day, s/he should go to RM. 129 (Nurse Rainey), RM. 104 (Ms. Schmidt), or the Dean’s Office in Rm. 127 (Dean Cordoba) any time during the day.  The parent/guardian will be notified and a PTL will be issued to the student.  The student must have the parent sign the
PTL, attach a note regarding the illness, and return the PTL for a Re-admit slip as per the Re-admit section.
                  Tardy to School/Cutting Classes:  Any loss of school time as the same effect- a loss of educational opportunity.  The dean will assign penalties.
Thank you for your cooperation!
